            <ol>
                <li>
                <h4>IENG 611 Introduction to Wood as a Building Material</h4>
                <p>This course provides an overview of using wood as a building material. The course first examines the macro and microscopic structures of wood, chemical compositions, physical and mechanical properties, and then covers a variety of structural wood-based products by exploring the manufacturing process, characteristics, mechanical properties and application in modern wood structures. The course also briefly introduces wood technologies related to the use of wood in building, fire properties and durability of wood.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>IENG 613 Wood Design I</h4>
                <p>This course explores the structural design of timber members and connections, with an emphasis on the behavior of wood as a structural material. It develops skills in designing timber elements and connections by CSA O86-19 standards. The course also fosters teamwork and problem-solving abilities essential to structural engineering practice. By the end of the course, students will be able to relate wood properties to structural applications, design timber members, and detail connections using CSA O86-19 provisions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>IENG 723 Wood Design II</h4>
                <p>This course covers the structural design of floor systems and lateral load resisting systems (LLRS), emphasizing the behavior and performance of both mass-timber and light-frame assemblies. Students develop the ability to analyze and design timber-concrete composite floors, shearwalls, diaphragms, and CLT lateral systems. The course also enhances teamwork and problem-solving skills relevant to structural engineering practice. By the end of the course, students will be able to design various floor systems and LLRS components using modern timber construction techniques.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>ENGR 700 Technical Writing</h4>
                <p>This course is an introduction to technical writing concepts for graduate students focusing on thesis and report writing. It is intended to help students improve their general writing skills while learning principles and approaches for producing good quality thesis, reports, and article manuscripts. Specific topics to be covered include thesis and report writing, improving grammar and organization, literature reviews, and referencing and documentation, including how to avoid plagiarism. Students prepare and submit a written report on a topic in Engineering related to their field of research.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>IENG 729 Structural Dynamics and Seismic Design</h4>
                <p>This course covers two subjects: Part I – Structural Dynamics and Part II – Seismic Design of Structures. Part I introduces concepts and theories of structural dynamics and then discusses methods for evaluating the dynamic response of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) and multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems subjected to various types of time-varying loads, including seismic excitation. Part II introduces elements of earthquake engineering, seismology, seismicity, and seismic hazard analysis and then discusses seismic design philosophies, principles, and approaches in compliance with the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC). Seismic design of various types of structures will be covered, including the design of seismic-force-resisting systems and seismic detailing requirements.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>ENGR 701-3 Graduate Seminar in Engineering</h4>
                <p>This course covers important engineering subject areas including risk assessment, safety, law, and ethics, and prepares the student to conduct master level research through seminar presentations and a written report related to the student’s thesis research. All MASc Engineering students are required to take it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>IENG 650 CAD/BIM</h4>
                <p>This course introduces the fundamentals of Building Information Modeling (BIM) using Autodesk Revit software. Students learn to navigate the Revit workspace, utilize essential drawing and editing tools, and create complete 3D building models including walls, windows, doors, floors, ceilings, and roofs. The course also covers the development of component-based and custom stairs, furniture and equipment integration, detail creation, and sheet setup for plotting. Additional topics include rendering, animation, and producing walkthroughs, equipping students with practical skills for professional architectural and structural design workflows.</p>
